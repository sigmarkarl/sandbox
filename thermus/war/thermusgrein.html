<h2>Thermus</h2>
<h3><i>Stefánsson, Sigmar K., Björnsdóttir, Snædís, Friðjónsson, Ólafur H., Pétursdóttir, S.P., Hreggviðsson, Guðmundur Ó.</i></h3>
<p><i>Thermus</i> bacteria are common inhabitants of neutral and alkaline hot springs worldwide. 
They are thermophiles that grow optimally at around 65-70°C (Table 1), usually by aerobic 
respiration and as consumers of organic matter (da Costa et al. 2001a).  
The genus Thermus now entails 13 validly described species (Table 1) and belongs to the 
<i>Thermaceae</i> family of the phylum <i>Deinococcus-Thermus</i> (da Costa et al. 2001b, Weisburg et al. 1989).
A second genus, <i>Meiothermus</i> was created in the same family to comprise strains that often
coexist with those of <i>Thermus</i> in terrestrial hot springs, albeit having lower temperature optima for growth (Nobre et al 1996).  
In recent years, four additional genera were created to accommodate further <i>Thermaceae</i>
representatives isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal habitats, <i>Marinithermus</i> (Sako et al. 2003), 
<i>Oceanithermus</i> (Miroshnichenko et al 2003a), <i>Rhabdothermus</i> (Steinsbu et al 2011) and <i>Vulcanithermus</i> (Miroshnichenko et al 2003b).
All encompass thermophilic strains that are phenotypically similar to those of <i>Thermus</i> and <i>Meiothermus</i>
although requiring salt for growth. <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> is the only <i>Thermus</i> species 
that grows in marine environments (Manaia et al 1994).
</p>

<p>
<div style="-webkit-column-count:2;
	-moz-column-count:2; 
	column-count:2;">
It is also the most thermophilic of the <i>Thermus</i> species and the sole member that exhibits growth at over 80°C (Table 1).
Indications for the adaptation of Thermus bacteria to growth at elevated temperatures were 
found when the genomic sequence of <i>T. thermophilus HB27</i> (Henne et al. 2004) was compared 
to that of the related but mesophilic <i>Deinococcus radiodurans</i> (Omelchenko et al. 2005).  
Reconstruction analysis of evolutionary events suggested that T. thermophilus acquired many 
genes from thermophilic archaea and bacteria after the divergence from the last common ancestor with 
D. radiodurans. Likewise, numerous foreign genes were detected in the genome of 
<i>Thermus scotoductus SA-01</i>, many of them derived from thermophiles (Gounder et al. 2011).
Horizontal gene transfer therefore seems to have contributed significantly to evolution within 
Thermus and to the adaptation to life at elevated temperatures.  The observed gene flux might 
be attributed to the direct uptake of genetic material as this ability has been experimentally 
demonstrated for both <i>T. scotoductus SA-01</i> and <i>T. thermophilus HB27</i> (Gounder et al. 2011, Koyama et al. 1986). 
The transformation system of the latter strain has been investigated in detail and a model devised (Averhoff 2009). 
The DNA uptake is highly efficient in <i>T. thermophilus HB27</i> and of a particularly broad 
substrate specificity (Schwarzenlander and Averhoff 2006, Koyama et al. 1986). 
Efficient gene transfer seems to provide T. thermophilus with a selective advantage.  
Genes conferring nitrate reduction and thus the capacity for anaerobic growth are among 
those shown to pass between strains through both transformation and an unknown mechanism 
of conjugation (Alvarez et al 2011, Ramirez-Arcos et al 1998). The capacity is, however, 
easily lost during passage at laboratory conditions (Alvarez et al. 2014).  Interestingly, 
the respective nitrate reductase gene cluster appears to be transiently present on a megaplasmid 
that was suggested as a reservoir for nonessential adaptive traits and shown to harbor numerous 
horizontally transferred genes (Cesar et al. 2011, Brüggeman and Chen 2006, Omelchenko et al. 2005). 
In fact, genomic rearrangements between strains HB27 and HB8 were mainly found in this megaplasmid (Brüggeman and Chen 2006).
The difference in gene content was mainly related to metabolic functions and proposed to reflect adaptations to different niches.  
Thermus species are phenotypically similar and their descriptions are predominantly based 
on rRNA sequence comparisons and DNA-DNA reassociation values. 
The composition of fatty acids and slight differences in the utilization of carbon sources 
support the descriptions although both traits are highly variable within Thermus species (Hreggvidsson et al. 2006, Balkwill et al. 2004, Chung et al. 2000).
In fact, no phenotypic character was attributed to the taxonomic status of Icelandic Thermus strains, except for the salt tolerance of T. thermophilus (Hreggvidsson et al. 2006). 
Furthermore, relationships were not found between the taxonomic status and the temperature measured where the isolates derived from. 
However, <i>Thermus igniterrae</i> and <i>Thermus brockianus</i> were generally isolated from more alkaline 
hot springs while <i>T. scotoductus</i> derived from neutral hot springs.  Habitat preferences of 
Thermus species within hot springs are nevertheless largely unexplained.  
Adaptation and species divergence within the genus has presumably been affected by geographic isolation. 
Thermus filiformis has only been isolated in New Zealand and differs in morphology from other 
Thermus species by being filamentous instead of rod-shaped (Hudson et al. 1987).  
Thermus aquaticus is another species that appears to be endemic and confined to thermal 
sites in North-America (Hreggvidsson et al. 2012).  Conversely, global distribution has 
been observed for several other Thermus species, including <i>T. thermophilus</i>, <i>T. oshimai</i>, <i>T. brockianus</i> and <i>T. scotoductus</i>.
Genetic diversity varies within Thermus species, even within those widely distributed (Hreggvidsson et al. 2012, 2006). 
Low diversity was detected in <i>T. brockianus</i> while sublineages possibly representing ecologically 
different populations were observed in <i>T. scotoductus</i>.  Indeed, adaptation to a unique habitat 
is exhibited by <i>T. socoductus strain SA-01</i>, which was isolated from fissure water in a 
South-African gold-mine at a depth of 3.2 km (van Heerden et al. 2008, Balkwill et al. 2004, Kieft et al. 1999). 
The strain can reduce a variety of metals and grows at oligotrophic conditions (Gounder et al. 2011). 
Gene flow, confined habitats and local adaptations are therefore among factors that appear to have 
influenced the genetic diversity and divergence within the genus <i>Thermus</i>.
We performed extensive comparative genomics and defined both the core and dispensible genomes 
for <i>Thermus</i> as the latter has been suggested to hold clues to bacterial niche adaptations (Tettelin et al. 2008).
We analysed published genome sequences and sequenced those of 18 additional Thermus strains, 
many of which derived from diverse hot springs in Iceland (Table 2). 
Representatives of all Thermus species valdily described prior to the year 2012 were included 
in the analysis as well as members of <i>Meiothermus</i>, <i>Marinithermus</i> and <i>Vulcanithermus</i>. 
Overall, the study included over 30 genome sequences and the results therefore give insight 
into the genetic structure and evolution within the genus as well as within individual <i>Thermus</i> species.

<b>Sequencing</b>
<p>The software accompanying the 454 machine, version 2.9, was used for processing of the raw data. 
Newbler v. 2.9 was used to assemble the sequences. 
Prodigal gene prediction software version 2.60 was used to find potential genes in the sequences. 
RNAmmer standalone version 1.2 was used to predict 5S/16S/23S rRNA sequences. 
tRNAscan v. 1.4 was used to scan for tRNA sequences. 
NCBI blast+ version 2.29 was used for blast processing such as rpsblast against the NCBI CDD cog and pfam databases, 
for reciprocal blast for gene clustering, ANI calculations and for blasting unknown genes against the NCBI nr database. 
The genes were clustered using the 50-50 rule implemented in the homemade ComGen software version 1.0. 
The 50-50 rule groups together genes with at least 50% sequence identity in at least 50% of their length. 
The ANI/AAI calculations are also implemented in the ComGen software. 
The ComGen software automatically fixes some gene prediction errors and annotations by comparing genes in clusters. 
The genes clusters were annotated with annotation of genes from known species in NCBI and JGI, with the JGI version preceding. 
Genes or gene clusters not clustered with known genes were then blasted against the NCBI nr database. 
Phylogeny calculations were done using neighbour joining and majority rule consensus tree algorithms implemented in the ComGen software. 
FastTree v. 2.1.7 was used for fast maximum likelihood phylogeny calculations. 
All trees were drawn using the web based phylogentic tree drawing software available at

<b>General statistics</b>
<p>
We compare 42 whole genome sequenced strains from the <i>Thermacae</i> family with focus on the <i>Thermus</i> generera. 
Of those, 32 are <i>Thermus</i> species, 18 of which are sequenced at MATIS and are draft genomes. 
11 are available from NCBI of which 4 are draft genomes. Also we used 3 draft sequences from Thermus strains from the Joint Genome Institue at DOE. 
The other generas, <i>Meiothermus</i>, <i>Marinithermus</i> and <i>Ocenithermus</i> are kept for phylogenetic tree rooting, comparision and evaluation of gene origin. 
3 of <i>Meiothermus</i> strains are draft genomes, the other completed, in total 7 strains. 
In terms of gene number, there is no notable difference between the <i>Thermus</i> strains, which on average is around 2400 genes. 
<i>Oceanithermus</i> and <i>Marinithermus</i> genomes are also in that range whereas <i>Meiothermus</i> has genomes with over 3000 genes.

</figure>
<p>
Skipping small genes (&lt;100 nt) the pan genome of 32 Thermus species is around 4000 OG‘s. The core genome counts around 1100 OG‘s. 
Although in general the pan genome grows more with the addition of new species, 
in some cases a growth within species underlines the plastisitic of the Thermus genomes.

<figcaption>GC% in <i>Thermacae</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The GC% of Thermus scotoductus species and the related <i>Thermus antranikianii</i> is less than 65% and considderably lower than in other 
<i>Thermus</i> species which is most cases is more than 68%. The <i>Thermus brockianus/eggertsoni</i> clade has GC% value in the range of 66-67%. 
The highest GC% was in the <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> strains which is some cases is over 69%. <i>Thermus scotoductus</i> strains have lower optimal --- temperature. 
The icelandic strains have lower GC% than the foreign ones in the cases of <i>Thermus igniterrae</i> and <i>Thermus antranikianii</i>. 
The non-UV/phytone (yellow pigmentation) <i>Themus scotoductus</i> strains also have higher GC% than other strains, &lt;64% compared to &lt;65%.

The COG categories have even distribution among the <i>Thermus</i> strains with around 20% of the genomes with no or unknown COG function (large gray and purple areas). 
The most variability is in the small groups. The <i>Thermus kawarayensis</i>, filiformis and brockianus strains have most number of genes designated as defense mechanism genes. 
The <i>Thermus islandicus</i> species have the larges groups containing cell motility and segregation genes. 
The lab strains <i>Thermus sp. RLM</i> and the <i>Thermus scotoductus</i> typestrain (252, DSM) have more cell division and chromosome partiioning genes than other strain.
