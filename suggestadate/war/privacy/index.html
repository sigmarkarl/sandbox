<h3>Suggest a date privacy policy</h3>

Only the emails of those who accept a date is collected. 
Your emails are used to establish contact between you and your potential date without the need of becoming friends on Facebook.

Once a date is removed (or rejected), all information, username, user id and emails are cleared from our database hosted at google appengine datastore services.
